# Overview
Boost.dev is a simple site with information about Imposter Syndrome that many developers can go through with different symptoms, and it aims to provide information about this subject and also present ideas about how the user can try to overcome this.<br>

It's meant to be an interactive and responsive site.

  - Users have access to posts related to the main subject
  - Users can do coding challenges in different levels

The site is designed to be responsive in different screen sizes.

Our main goal is to let the user know that they are great developers and hopefully to let them improve their confidence with coding and to help others in similar situation, creating a supporting community for developers that have low-confidence.

## UX - User Experience
This project was inspired in 2 sites:

  - [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/)
  - [gamma.app](https://gamma.app/docs/boostdev-Where-Confidence-Grows-ltxw0nuvix1u7ue?mode=doc)

Fiirst site was known to one of the members of the group and the second is a template made by the same member about Imposter Syndrome.

As the look seemed well put and  a great start, the steam thought about taking this idea and changing it with inspiration also on "daily.dev" for the main site after the user registers or logs in the site.

We took the same name, and developed a different landing page and worked on the main site, providing some information for the user even before he registers on the site.

We opted for a simple and minimalistic layout and logo and to focus more on the content to get the attention for the issue that the "Imposter Syndrome" can present to the user and hoepfully make him/her feel encouraged to register, improve his/her confidence, as well as to try to overcome it and help others while also improving his/her skills.

## Colour Scheme
Following the initial idea from our colleague, we used similar colours to the ones used on "boost.dev" and adapted as necessary for better contrast, tryin gto keep it simple.

Colours - checked against WCAG for contrast 

#581CA0 - Purple (from the canva mind map)<br>
#312fa6 - Indigo<br>
#b12e5d - Roseberry<br>
#0088cc - Bright blue<br>
#121212 - Dark background<br>
#ffffff - White<br>

<img src="theme\static\css\images\colour-palette.png" style="width: 90%; height: 60%;"><br>

| Colour      | WCAG Ratio (against #121212) | WCAG Contrast          |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Purple      | Pass (7.1:1)                 | ‚úÖ AAA                 |
| Indigo      | Pass (8.23:1)                | ‚úÖ‚úÖ AAA               |
| Roseberry   | Pass (6.71:1)                | ‚úÖ‚úÖ AAA               |
| Bright Blue | Pass (6.95:1)                | ‚úÖ‚úÖ AAA               |

## Contrast Check
<img src="theme\static\css\images\contrast-check-1.png"><br>

## Typography
Fonts used for this website were:

  - [open sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
  - [Segoe UI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/segoe-ui)
  - [Helvetica-Neue](https://www.cdnfonts.com/helvetica-neue-5.font)

# Project Planning

The main goal for this project was to create a site that feels friendly, invitting and can provide users the feeling that they are good developers, although they might not see themselves in that way.<br>

## Strategy

  - User-friendly platform to post artwork
  - Appealing and minimalistic layout and colors
  - Show simple and easy to select menus
  - Ensure consistent UX thoughout multiple platforms, as mobile devices, tablets, and desktops
  - Develop a platform that can be improved with new features in the future

## Agile Methodologies
Boost.dev was the first hackathon with people from different courses for one of our members and a review for the rest of the group, although in the begining we started getting roles, during the project, each one of us got to manage and push the others at different times, with discussions about different features happening throughout the process and all members having the opportunity to express their views.

Issues and features can be seen on [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/Lochy2000/projects/7).

With each iteration of the Agile methogologies, the website was improved and we did our best to improve our skills and knowledge of the project management, which we had used in previous projects, but that can always be improved.

These will also be very important for future projects, either personal or professional, with Hackathons being a great way to also get more practice with Agile methodologies.

### Django Project Setup<br>
Install Django and supporting libraries:<br>
  - pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn<br>
  - pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2<br>
  - pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage<br>

Once you have installed any relevant dependencies or libraries, such as the ones listed above, it is important to create a requirements.txt file and add all installed libraries to it with the pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt command in the terminal.

Create a new Django project in the terminal django-admin startproject ems .

Create a new app eg. python3 mangage.py startapp events

Add this to list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py - 'booking',

Create a superuser for the project to allow Admin access and enter credentials: python3 manage.py createsuperuser

Migrate the changes with commands: python3 manage.py migrate

An env.py file must be created to store all protected data such as the 
DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY. These may be called upon in your project's settings.py file along with your Database configurations. The env.py file must be added to your gitignore file so that your important, protected information is not pushed to public viewing on GitHub. For adding to env.py:

  - import os
  - os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURLfrom postgresql://neondb_owner>"
  - os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="my_super^secret@key"

For adding to settings.py:

  - import os
  - import dj_database_url
  - if os.path.exists("env.py"):
  - import env
  - SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') (actual key hidden within env.py)

Replace DATABASES with:

DATABASES = {<br>
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))<br>
  }

Set up the templates directory in settings.py:
  - Under BASE_DIR enter TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ‚Äòtemplates‚Äô)
  - Update TEMPLATES = 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR] with:<br>
  os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),<br>
  os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates', 'allauth')<br>
  - Create the media, static and templates directories in top level of project file in IDE workspace.<br>
  
A Procfile must be created within the project repo for Heroku deployment with the following placed within it: web: gunicorn ems.wsgi

Make the necessary migrations again.

[Back to top](#top)

### Cloudinary API
Cloudinary provides a cloud hosting solution for media storage. All users uploaded images in the FreeFid project are hosted here.

Set up a new account at Cloudinary and add your Cloudinary API environment variable to your env.py and Heroku Config Vars. In your project workspace:

  - Add Cloudinary libraries to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
  - In the order:<br>
   'cloudinary_storage',<br>
   'django.contrib.staticfiles',  <br>
   'cloudinary',<br>

  - Add to env.py and link up with settings.py: os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]="cloudinary://...."
  - Set Cloudinary as storage for media and static files in settings.py:
  - STATIC_URL = '/static/'<br>
  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'<br>  
  STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]<br>
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')‚Äå<br>  
  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'<br>  
  DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'<br>

[Back to top](#top)

### Heroku deployment
To start the deployment process , please follow the below steps:

  - Log in to Heroku or create an account if you are a new user.

  - Once logged in, in the Heroku Dashboard, navigate to the 'New' button in the top, right corner, and select 'Create New App'.

  - Enter an app name and choose your region. Click 'Create App'.

  - In the Deploy tab, click on the 'Settings', reach the 'Config Vars' section and click on 'Reveal Config Vars'. Here you will enter KEY:VALUE pairs for the app to run successfully. The KEY:VALUE pairs that you will need are your:<br>
CLOUDINARY_URL: cloudinary://....<br>
DATABASE_URL:postgres://...<br>
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC of value '1' (N.B Remove this Config Var before deployment),<br>
PORT:8000<br>
SECRET_KEY and value<br>

  - Add the Heroku host name into ALLOWED_HOSTS in your projects settings.py file ->  ['800-nielmc-django-project-lxqprmm3qz.us2.codeanyapp.com', '.herokuapp.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1'].

  - Once you are sure that you have set up the required files including your requirements.txt and Procfile, you have ensured that DEBUG=False, save your project, add the files, commit for initial deployment and push the data to GitHub.

  - Go to the 'Deploy' tab and choose GitHub as the Deployment method.

  - Search for the repository name, select the branch that you would like to build from, and connect it via the 'Connect' button.

  - Choose from 'Automatic' or 'Manual' deployment options, I chose the 'Manual' deployment method. Click 'Deploy Branch'.

  - Once the waiting period for the app to build has finished, click the 'View' link to bring you to your newly deployed site. If you receive any errors, Heroku will display a reason in the app build log for you to investigate. DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC may be removed from the Config Vars once you have saved and pushed an image within your project, as can PORT:8000.

## Tailwind CSS Setup

These instructions will guide you through setting up Tailwind CSS in your Django project using django-tailwind.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation

1.  Install django-tailwind:

    ```bash
    pip install django-tailwind==4.0.1
    ```

2.  Initialize Tailwind CSS for your app (replace "theme" with your app name if different):

    ```bash
    python manage.py tailwind init --app-name theme
    ```

3.  Add `tailwind` and your app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

### Bugs to fix
- Celebrations on the wins not working, allthough the logic looks good.

## AI Implementaion and Orchestration
### Code Generation
The GitHub Copilot extension was installed in our local versions of Visual Studio Code. <br>
We were able to write prompts or highlight functions in pseudocode and ask Copilot to suggest code snippets. <br>
We had to review suggestions before they were included, as AI can generate code that can refer to different features than the ones intended.<br>
We also used [deepseek](https://www.deepseek.com/en), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) and [Claude](https://claude.ai/new) to help with code generation.

### Debugging
Regularly used the AI sites and tools mentioned above for debugging code using the inline editor and also prompting to on VS-Code side chat to request changes to the site and content for the site. 

### Code Optimisation
When needing to make more complicated changes to code or part of a page, the different AI sites were used to help fixing them and these were generally tested before pushing to repo, making it most of the times quicker to fix the code or create new code.<br>

### Impact on Workflow
Overall It was useful to work with Copilot and have help to build many parts of the site.<br>
AI was also a good help to debug and test the code.<br>
Copilot and other AI as Claude in different ways, have explained the different steps involved in the coding, why some code is better than another.<br>
Sometimes it can be furstrating to get some suggestions with ghost code that is not needed for the page to work well or changing different pages/files instead of only 1 ir 2 lines of code to fix a bug, but with testing, errors can be fixed.<br>

## Credits
### Code References
Website was inspired on the "Blog" walkthrough project by [Code Institute Bootcamp LMS](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/dashboard) using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Django, Python and other extra tools to allow the user to be able to login into the page without having to use the admin panel.
<br>

### Acknowledgements
This was a tough hackathon as 2-3 members of the initial group left in the begining or did not contribute for the project, with the Hack Team being aware of this, and the 3 remaining members had to push hard and motivate each other to continue the project.<br>

It was a fun experience, with everyone learning something new in different ways, great communication and motivation.
